- 👋 Hi, I’m @Raggyshaggy98
- 👀 I’m interested in hardware(robotics and Raspi/Arduino), Ux(Sharepoint and HTML), Python and game-development with Unreal Engine
- 🌱 I’m currently learning generic game-development and python
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on any code yet as i dont feel qualified to do so, i am working on my english, so writing documentation is perhaps the best thing  i can contribute with.
